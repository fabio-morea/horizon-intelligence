# Horizon intelligence
Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe are key EU initiatives fostering collaborative research and innovation across Europe. The data about Horizon programmes can be explored via the CORDIS Data Lab at https://cordis.europa.eu/datalab/  and can be accessed trough https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/cordish2020projects for Horizon 2020 and https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/cordis-eu-research-projects-under-horizon-europe-2021-2027 
for Horizon Europe..

The Horizon intelligence software aims to provide an additional method for analyzing the impact of Horizon projects, specifically in terms of collaborations among European organizations, leveraging network analysis and community detection techniques. The dataset has been enriched with NUTS3 geolocation data and name tags for Italian organizations and is segmented by year, covering the period from 2015 to 2029.

Some case studies created with Horizon ingelligence are published on Zenodo as the Horozon projects network dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13765372
